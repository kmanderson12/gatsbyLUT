Galatians 6:9

---

Paul assumes that Christians will be doing good things.

“Good” - The Good. That which is beautiful, virtuous.

This texts calls us to get our hands dirty in loving and caring for others. Christianity is not merely an academic faith. We not only love God and others with our minds, but also with our hearts and hands.

The duration - As long as the Lord wills.
“As long as we have opportunity” - not merely when it’s convenient. He’s not thinking about our day planner or calendar–he’s thinking about our era in history. In this time between the Resurrection and the Return.

“Do not grow weary” - The Bible is very realistic: it assumes we will grow weary.

> This phrase is necessary because humans are by nature lazy.
> John Calvin

The nearness of the Lord’s Return is a motivation for diligence not negligence.

Why are we prone to grow weary?

- Short-sightedness - We want it instantly or not at all. Even so many of our church metrics are centered around immediate results.
- Shallow commitment - We prefer no resistance. Once greater effort is required, we bail.

What’s our motivation? According to the Bible, we **will** reap.

Who benefits from this? Neighbors and brothers and sisters.
