Galatians 6:7-8

---

Paul believes in a perfectly Sovereign God. But he also believes in the sober reality of human responsibility.

1. A needed reminder of the Law.
   “Do not be deceived: God is not mocked.”

Previous verses remind us of the danger of self-deception and deception from corrupt teachers.
God built sowing and reaping into human experience to give us a picture of our spiritual reality.
There is always consequence to the seed that is planted. Don’t be deceived: if you are sowing to corruption you will reap corruption.
Things reproduce after their kind. Sin gives birth to more sin—to death.

> We live in a spoken world.
> N.D. Wilson

Christ is upholding this world by the word of his power. He has spoken this law/principle into our life.

To live in defiance of this law—to willingly live deceived—is to live in mockery of God.

We’re not helpless victims of our nature. For those who trust Christ, what we become depends on the one we trust in and how we follow after him. My moment by moment decisions matter.

> Wow a thought, reap an act. Sow an act, reap a habit. Sow a habit, reap a character.
> John Stott

Our tiny decisions have enormous effects. Like the potential of a forest is contained in a small seed, the potential of our future self is in the small thoughts and hidden decisions we make every day.
