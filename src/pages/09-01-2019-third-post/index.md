Galatians 6:6

---

If you were given the power to give yourself “the good life”, what would it look like?
Would you intentionally put yourself into a life of community—interdependence?

Is the good life to you a life of independence, free from the cares and constraints of others?

The relationship we are most eager to detach from is one of authority.
God will not relate to you apart from a posture of authority. He is rightfully Lord.

He has scattered his authority out across our lives as a way of pointing and directing us to His ultimate authority. Dependence on those who express that authority is a good thing.

#### Two Lenses We Can View This Text Through:

- Paul is talking about mutuality. Two parties sharing of the good things they’ve been given.
- It’s speaking of the relationship between the teacher and those receiving the teaching.

“The one who is taught” - from the Greek root κατηχέω

Three Implications:

1. The _primary_ work of the pastor is to preach and teach. Not the primary administrator. Not the face of public relations.

> I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching.
> **2 Timothy 4:1-2**

Temptations:

1. Pastors will be tempted to neglect laboring in the Word if things seem fine—the budget is good and attendance is good.
2. Pastors will view it as any other career and always look to the next church and a better pay package.
3. Church members are tempted to fail to be regular in their giving. Don’t plan to give.
